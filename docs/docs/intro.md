# What is Arkiver?

**Arkiver** is an **end-to-end blockchain indexing service** that allows you to query data from various blockchains, process them through your own functions written in **TypeScript**, and store them in a database to be read from a **GraphQL API**. It is built on top of [**Deno**](https://deno.land/) with **simplicity**, **flexibility** and **performance** in mind.

Read on to get started by creating your first Arkive.
