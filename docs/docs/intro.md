# What is Arkiver?

**Arkiver** is a **service** that allows you to **query** and **index** data from **various blockchains**. It is built on top of [**Deno**](https://deno.land/) and allows you to write your **data sources** and **indexing functions** in **plain TypeScript** (*or JavaScript*). It is built with **simplicity**, **flexibility** and **performance** in mind. You no longer need to learn **3 different languages and schemas** to index blockchain data, enjoy **full type safety** and use a **single language** for everything.

Read on to get started by writing your first Arkive.
